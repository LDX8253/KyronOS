# KSFS format

KSFS is an original, little-endian, fixed-block format. Every block is 4096 bytes. Block 0 is the superblock, block 1 is the free-block bitmap, and blocks beginning at block 2 hold the inode table. Directory and file data follow the inode table.

The superblock contains: magic `0x4B534653` (`KSFS`), version `1`, block size, total blocks, free blocks, inode-table block, inode count, root inode `1`, bitmap block, and an FNV-1a checksum over all fields except checksum. `BlockDevice` supplies full-block reads and writes, keeping KSFS independent of controller hardware.

The implementation formats and validates a superblock, allocates fixed-size inodes and up to twelve direct data blocks, stores directory entries, creates files and directories, reads file contents after remounting, and removes files or empty directories. `fs::Installer` creates the initial KyronOS root tree. Run `make mkfs IMAGE=build/kyronos.disk BLOCKS=1024` to create a host-side installed image; attaching that image to a booted kernel still requires a storage controller driver and mount path.
